## My Research Areas

### **Seismic Anisotropy and Tectonic Processes**
I use **seismic imaging techniques** to study anisotropy and its connection to tectonic evolution in subduction zones and strike-slip fault systems.

### **Current Projects**
- **Seismic Imaging of the Juan de Fuca Plate**
- **Crustal Deformation Analysis in Alaska**
- **Ice Flow Constraints from Seismic Anisotropy**
