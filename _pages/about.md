## About

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the **Jackson School of Geosciences** and a postdoctoral researcher at the **University of Texas Institute for Geophysics**. I am interested in using seismic imaging and advanced inversion techniques to investigate Earth’s subsurface dynamics, particularly **seismic anisotropy** and its connection to tectonic processes.

By utilizing global seismic datasets—such as surface and body waves extracted from ambient seismic noise and teleseismic earthquakes—and developing novel imaging tools, I have constructed **3D isotropic and anisotropic seismic models** for:
- The **Alaskan continent**
- The **Aleutian subduction zone**
- The **Juan de Fuca-Gorda plates**

These models have provided **new insights into tectonic processes** shaping these regions.

My current research focuses on **advancing seismic imaging techniques** and exploring the interplay between seismic anisotropy, deformation, and geodynamic processes across various geological settings, including **subduction zones, large-scale strike-slip fault systems, and ice flow regions**.
